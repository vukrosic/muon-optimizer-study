# Interpreting Ablation Studies

An ablation study is a scientific method where components of a system are removed or altered to understand their individual contribution to the system's overall performance. In machine learning, this often involves systematically changing hyperparameters or architectural components of a model or optimizer to see how these changes affect metrics like loss, accuracy, and training time.

## Key Metrics in this Study

### 1. Validation Loss

*   **What it is:** A measure of how well the model's predictions match the true values on a separate validation dataset (data not used during training). Lower validation loss indicates a better-performing model.
*   **Interpretation:** The primary metric for evaluating the effectiveness of different Muon configurations. A lower validation loss is generally desired.

### 2. Validation Perplexity (PPL)

*   **What it is:** A common metric for evaluating language models. It measures how well a probability model predicts a sample. Lower perplexity indicates a better model.
*   **Interpretation:** Similar to validation loss, lower perplexity is better. It provides another perspective on the model's predictive power.

### 3. Validation Accuracy

*   **What it is:** The proportion of correctly classified instances on the validation dataset.
*   **Interpretation:** Higher accuracy indicates better classification performance. While loss and perplexity are often more granular, accuracy provides a straightforward measure of correctness.

### 4. Training Time (s)

*   **What it is:** The time taken to train the model for a specified number of steps or epochs.
*   **Interpretation:** A crucial metric for practical applications. Faster training times are desirable, especially for large models or frequent retraining. There's often a trade-off between performance (loss/accuracy) and training time.

### 5. Improvement vs. Base

*   **What it is:** The percentage improvement or degradation in validation loss compared to a baseline Muon configuration (e.g., "Muon Base (5 steps, 0.95 momentum)").
*   **Interpretation:** Helps quantify the impact of specific hyperparameter changes. Positive percentages indicate improvement, while negative percentages indicate degradation.

## How to Interpret the Visualizations

### Performance Comparison Plot

This plot typically visualizes the key performance metrics (e.g., validation loss, perplexity, accuracy) for each optimizer variant.
*   **Look for:** Variants that consistently perform well across multiple metrics.
*   **Insights:** Helps identify the overall best-performing configurations and understand trade-offs between different metrics.

### Training Curves Plot

These plots show the validation loss (and possibly training loss) over training steps or epochs for different optimizer variants.
*   **Look for:** How quickly each variant converges, whether it overfits (validation loss starts increasing while training loss decreases), and the stability of the training process.
*   **Insights:** Provides a dynamic view of the training process, revealing convergence speed, stability, and potential issues like overfitting or underfitting.

### Performance Heatmap

A heatmap can visually represent the interaction between two hyperparameters and their effect on a specific metric (e.g., validation loss).
*   **Look for:** Hotspots (areas with optimal performance) or cold spots (areas with poor performance) in the grid.
*   **Insights:** Helps identify optimal combinations of hyperparameters and understand their joint impact.

By carefully analyzing these metrics and visualizations, one can draw conclusions about the effectiveness of different Muon configurations and gain a deeper understanding of the optimizer's behavior.
